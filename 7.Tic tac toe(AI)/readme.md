# Tic Tac Toe with AI and Minimax Algorithm
This Python implementation of Tic Tac Toe offers various player types and customization options, including different difficulty levels for the computer player. Here's an overview of its features:

# Key Features
1. Multiple Player Types: Choose between human players and computer players.
2. AI Difficulty Levels:
    * Random computer player: Makes random moves.
    * Smart computer player: Utilizes the minimax algorithm for strategic moves.
3. Customization Options:
    * Choose the starting player (X or O).
    * Control whether the game board is printed during play.
4. Clear Code Structure: Well-organized code with comments for better understanding.
# Player Types
* HumanPlayer: Takes input from the user via the console.
* RandomComputerPlayer: Makes random moves, adding an element of chance.
* SmartComputerPlayer: Utilizes the minimax algorithm to analyze possible moves and choose the best one, providing a challenging opponent.
# Minimax Algorithm
The minimax algorithm employed by the SmartComputerPlayer enables intelligent decision-making by:
* Simulating all possible future game states.
* Evaluating each state based on factors like control of squares and winning possibilities.
* Choosing the best move that maximizes its chances of winning and minimizes the opponent's.

# Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python.

# Overview
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

# Features
1. Player Classes: Two player classes are implemented - HumanPlayer for human players and RandomComputerPlayer for computer players making random moves.
2. Game Logic: The TicTacToe class handles the game logic, including checking for a winner, making moves, and printing the game board.
3. Game Playback: The play function orchestrates the game by alternating player turns until the game is won or ends in a tie.
# How to Play
1. Run the player.py file to initialize the player classes.
2. Run the game.py file to start a game of Tic Tac Toe.
3. Enter moves according to the prompt (for HumanPlayer) or watch the computer make random moves (for RandomComputerPlayer).
4. The game will continue until a player wins or the board is full (resulting in a tie).

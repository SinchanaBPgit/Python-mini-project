Photo Manipulation in Python
This Python script provides a collection of image processing functions. These functions allow users to perform various operations on images such as adjusting brightness, contrast, applying blurs, and detecting edges using kernels like Sobel.

Features
Adjust Brightness: This function adjusts the brightness of an image by multiplying each pixel value by a factor.

Adjust Contrast: The contrast of an image can be adjusted by scaling pixel values around a user-defined midpoint.

Blur: The blur function applies a blur effect to an image using a specified kernel size.

Apply Kernel: This function convolves an image with a user-defined kernel for operations like edge detection.

Combine Images: Combines two images using the squared sum of squares method.
